# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The np-hard-lab is an educational testbed project designed to provide hands-on exploration of the P vs NP problem through practical implementations and benchmarking. The project will demonstrate the computational complexity gap between polynomial-time (P) and non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) problems by implementing classic NP-complete problems with both brute-force and optimized approaches. Users will be able to run benchmarks, visualize performance differences, and learn about computational complexity theory through real code examples and timing comparisons.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a computer science student or educator, I want to run SAT solver demonstrations, so that I can understand the computational complexity differences between brute-force and optimized approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the SAT solver demo THEN the system SHALL execute both brute-force and optimized SAT solvers on the same 3-SAT instance
2. WHEN both solvers complete THEN the system SHALL display execution times for comparison
3. WHEN the solvers produce results THEN the system SHALL indicate whether the instance is satisfiable or unsatisfiable
4. IF the brute-force solver takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide a timeout mechanism
5. WHEN generating test instances THEN the system SHALL create configurable 3-SAT problems with variable numbers of variables and clauses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher or student, I want to benchmark multiple NP-complete problems, so that I can compare their computational characteristics and scaling behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs benchmarks THEN the system SHALL execute tests for SAT, Subset Sum, and Traveling Salesman problems
2. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL record execution times, problem sizes, and solution status
3. WHEN benchmark data is collected THEN the system SHALL save results to a structured format (CSV)
4. WHEN running multiple problem sizes THEN the system SHALL demonstrate exponential vs polynomial scaling patterns
5. IF any benchmark exceeds reasonable time limits THEN the system SHALL implement timeout controls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner exploring computational complexity, I want visual representations of performance data, so that I can clearly see the scaling differences between algorithms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmark data exists THEN the system SHALL generate graphs showing execution time vs problem size
2. WHEN displaying graphs THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between brute-force and optimized approaches
3. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL include logarithmic and linear scale options
4. WHEN graphs are generated THEN the system SHALL save them as image files for documentation
5. WHEN multiple algorithms are compared THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors and labels for clarity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an educator or self-learner, I want comprehensive documentation explaining P vs NP concepts, so that I can understand the theoretical background behind the implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the project THEN the system SHALL provide a clear README with project overview and setup instructions
2. WHEN reading documentation THEN the system SHALL include explanations of P, NP, and NP-Complete concepts
3. WHEN exploring implementations THEN the system SHALL provide code comments explaining algorithmic approaches
4. WHEN learning about specific problems THEN the system SHALL include real-world applications and significance
5. WHEN following tutorials THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step instructions for running demonstrations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer extending the project, I want a well-structured codebase with tests, so that I can confidently add new algorithms or modify existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL organize code into logical modules for each problem type
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify correctness of all solver implementations
3. WHEN adding new algorithms THEN the system SHALL provide clear interfaces and patterns to follow
4. WHEN modifying code THEN the system SHALL include unit tests that validate algorithm correctness
5. WHEN contributing to the project THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent code style and documentation standards

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user running experiments, I want configurable problem generators, so that I can test algorithms on various input sizes and characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating SAT instances THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of variable count and clause count
2. WHEN creating Subset Sum problems THEN the system SHALL generate configurable set sizes and target values
3. WHEN building TSP instances THEN the system SHALL create configurable city counts and distance matrices
4. WHEN generating test cases THEN the system SHALL provide both random and structured problem instances
5. WHEN configuring generators THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters and provide reasonable defaults
